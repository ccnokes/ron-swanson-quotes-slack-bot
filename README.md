# Ron Swanson Quotes Slack Bot
Adds a slash command to post Ron Swanson quotes to Slack

For example `/ron` returns "Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.". 
You can also pass a topic. For example `/ron manly` returns "Cultivating a manly musk puts your opponents on notice."

I'm open to contributions or feature ideas!
